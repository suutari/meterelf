Meter Elf
=========

This project implements dial meter value reading by computer vision
using OpenCV with Python.

It currently works just for my configuration with exactly the same
parameters (like type of water meter, position and angle of the webcam,
lighting conditions, etc.), but I plan to make it more general in the
future.
